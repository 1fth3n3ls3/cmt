   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to cmt's documentation!
===============================

cmt is a collection of various Maya tools I have written for my personal projects.

Installation Instructions
=========================
cmt is Maya module that can be installed like all other Maya modules. You can do one of the
following:

* Add the cmt root directory to the MAYA_MODULE_PATH environment variable.
* Add the cmt root directory to the MAYA_MODULE_PATH in your Maya.env. e.g.
  MAYA_MODULE_PATH += /path/to/cmt
* Edit the cmt.mod file, and replace the ./ with the full path to the cmt root directory,
  then copy the cmt.mod file to where your modules are loaded from.
